What does the Browser Extension do?
------

The Browser Extension helps you to create Marble Cards. The problem is, URLs are often assigned.
To check a URL you usually have to go to the Marble Card https://marble.cards/ website and check if a URL is out of stock.

With this Browser Extension this back and forth is over.
