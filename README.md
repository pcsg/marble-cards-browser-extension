What are Marble cards, anyway?

- Once a card is created, that URL is claimed forever
- All Marble cards are non-fungible tokens built on Ethereum

What does the Browser Extension do?
------

The Browser Extension helps you to create Marble Cards.The problem is, URLs are often assigned.
To check a URL you usually have to go to the Marble Card https://marble.cards/ website and check if a URL is out of stock.

With this Browser Extension this back and forth is over.
